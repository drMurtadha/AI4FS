### Literature search
Among the most important aspects of academic research is literature search, which involves systematic exploration and retrieval of relevant scholarly information. To conduct comprehensive searches, researchers use a variety of tools and databases. A multidisciplinary database such as [Scopus](https://www.scopus.com/search/form.uri?display=basic#basic) and [Web of Science](https://access.clarivate.com/login?app=wos&alternative=true&shibShireURL=https:%2F%2Fwww.webofknowledge.com%2F%3Fauth%3DShibboleth&shibReturnURL=https:%2F%2Fwww.webofknowledge.com%2F&roaming=true) provides access to a wide range of academic literature, while [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com/) is an easy-to-use search engine that can be used across multiple disciplines. With [Semantic Scholar](https://www.semanticscholar.org/), you can refine your search using artificial intelligence, while with [PubMed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/) you can find biomedical and life sciences articles. With [EvidenceHunt](https://github.com/drMurtadha/SLR-FC/blob/main/materials/pubmed/evidence-hunt.md), you can facilitate evidence-based research, and with [Publish or Perish](https://harzing.com/resources/publish-or-perish), you can assess research impact based on citation metrics. Platforms such as [Zeta Alpha](https://search.zeta-alpha.com/) and [Consensus.app](https://consensus.app/) offer collaborative research and decision-making capabilities. Additionally, [scite.ai](https://scite.ai/) assists researchers in assessing the reliability of scientific claims. Researchers can explore and retrieve literature efficiently using this diverse array of tools.
