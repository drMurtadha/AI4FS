### Literature search
Among the most important aspects of academic research is **literature search**, which involves systematic exploration and retrieval of relevant scholarly information. To conduct comprehensive searches, researchers use a variety of tools and databases. A multidisciplinary database such as **[Scopus](https://www.scopus.com/search/form.uri?display=basic#basic)** and [**Web of Science**](https://access.clarivate.com/login?app=wos&alternative=true&shibShireURL=https:%2F%2Fwww.webofknowledge.com%2F%3Fauth%3DShibboleth&shibReturnURL=https:%2F%2Fwww.webofknowledge.com%2F&roaming=true) provides access to a wide range of academic literature, while [**Google Scholar**](https://scholar.google.com/) is an easy-to-use search engine that can be used across multiple disciplines. With [**Semantic Scholar**](https://www.semanticscholar.org/), you can refine your search using artificial intelligence, while with [**PubMed**](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/) you can find biomedical and life sciences articles. With [**EvidenceHunt**](https://github.com/drMurtadha/SLR-FC/blob/main/materials/pubmed/evidence-hunt.md), you can facilitate evidence-based research, and with [**Publish or Perish**](https://harzing.com/resources/publish-or-perish), you can assess research impact based on citation metrics. Platforms such as [**Zeta Alpha**](https://search.zeta-alpha.com/) and [**Consensus.app**](https://consensus.app/) offer collaborative research and decision-making capabilities. Additionally, [**scite.ai**](https://scite.ai/) assists researchers in assessing the reliability of scientific claims. Researchers can explore and retrieve literature efficiently using this diverse array of tools.

## Paper Discovery
Artificial intelligence (AI) tools significantly improve **paper discovery**, the challenging task of finding pertinent academic papers among the vast volume of papers published annually. Advanced algorithms are used in these tools, such as [**Connected Papers**](https://www.connectedpapers.com/), [**R Discovery**](https://rdiscovery.com/), [**Humata AI**](https://www.humata.ai/), [**Litmaps**](https://litmaps.co/), [**ResearchRabbit**](https://www.researchrabbit.ai/), and [**Inciteful**](https://inciteful.com/), to streamline and optimize the paper discovery process. Using machine learning, **Connected Papers** analyzes citation patterns to reveal relationships between papers. In order to provide personalized paper suggestions, **R Discovery** uses recommendation algorithms and natural language processing. Using NLP, **Humata AI** analyzes paper content and offers tailored recommendations. With **Litmaps**, users can discover thematic papers using machine learning and natural language processing. **Inciteful** uses artificial intelligence to understand user behavior and recommend relevant articles, while **ResearchRabbit** analyzes user inputs to recommend relevant papers. These AI tools contribute to paper discovery efficiency and effectiveness, making it easier for researchers to navigate the expansive academic landscape.

## Paper Visualization

Using advanced artificial intelligence techniques, paper visualization tools help researchers navigate and comprehend the complex landscape of scholarly literature. Using semantic analysis and machine learning algorithms, [Open Knowledge Maps](V) create interactive visual knowledge maps that provide an intuitive overview of a research topic. **A network visualization created by VOSviewer is based on clustering algorithms and term extraction methods, facilitating the exploration of relationships between papers, authors, and keywords.** **In CiteSpace, emerging trends are detected using algorithms and the chronological evolution of fields is visualized using algorithms.** **In bibliometric data, Gephi provides visually appealing graphs for exploring connections.** **The Bibliometrix package combines statistical methods with visualization capabilities to create insightful visualizations, such as co-authorship networks and keyword co-occurrence maps.** Researchers can navigate and contribute to the scholarly conversation more efficiently with the help of these AI-powered tools.
