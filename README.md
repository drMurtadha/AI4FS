### Literature search
Among the most important aspects of academic research is literature search, which involves systematic exploration and retrieval of relevant scholarly information. To conduct comprehensive searches, researchers use a variety of tools and databases. A multidisciplinary database such as Scopus and (Web of Science)[https://access.clarivate.com/login?app=wos&alternative=true&shibShireURL=https:%2F%2Fwww.webofknowledge.com%2F%3Fauth%3DShibboleth&shibReturnURL=https:%2F%2Fwww.webofknowledge.com%2F&roaming=true] provides access to a wide range of academic literature, while Google Scholar is an easy-to-use search engine that can be used across multiple disciplines. With Semantic Scholar, you can refine your search using artificial intelligence, while with PubMed you can find biomedical and life sciences articles. With EvidenceHunt, you can facilitate evidence-based research, and with Publish or Perish, you can assess research impact based on citation metrics. Platforms such as Zeta Alpha and Consensus.app offer collaborative research and decision-making capabilities. Additionally, scite.ai assists researchers in assessing the reliability of scientific claims. Researchers can explore and retrieve literature efficiently using this diverse array of tools.
