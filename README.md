### Literature search
Among the most important aspects of academic research is **literature search**, which involves systematic exploration and retrieval of relevant scholarly information. To conduct comprehensive searches, researchers use a variety of tools and databases. A multidisciplinary database such as **[Scopus](https://www.scopus.com/search/form.uri?display=basic#basic)** and [**Web of Science**](https://access.clarivate.com/login?app=wos&alternative=true&shibShireURL=https:%2F%2Fwww.webofknowledge.com%2F%3Fauth%3DShibboleth&shibReturnURL=https:%2F%2Fwww.webofknowledge.com%2F&roaming=true) provides access to a wide range of academic literature, while [**Google Scholar**](https://scholar.google.com/) is an easy-to-use search engine that can be used across multiple disciplines. With [**Semantic Scholar**](https://www.semanticscholar.org/), you can refine your search using artificial intelligence, while with [**PubMed**](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/) you can find biomedical and life sciences articles. With [**EvidenceHunt**](https://github.com/drMurtadha/SLR-FC/blob/main/materials/pubmed/evidence-hunt.md), you can facilitate evidence-based research, and with [**Publish or Perish**](https://harzing.com/resources/publish-or-perish), you can assess research impact based on citation metrics. Platforms such as [**Zeta Alpha**](https://search.zeta-alpha.com/) and [**Consensus.app**](https://consensus.app/) offer collaborative research and decision-making capabilities. Additionally, [**scite.ai**](https://scite.ai/) assists researchers in assessing the reliability of scientific claims. Researchers can explore and retrieve literature efficiently using this diverse array of tools.

### Paper Discovery
Artificial intelligence (AI) tools significantly improve **paper discovery**, the challenging task of finding pertinent academic papers among the vast volume of papers published annually. Advanced algorithms are used in these tools, such as [**Connected Papers**](https://www.connectedpapers.com/), [**R Discovery**](https://rdiscovery.com/), [**Humata AI**](https://www.humata.ai/), [**Litmaps**](https://litmaps.co/), [**ResearchRabbit**](https://www.researchrabbit.ai/), and [**Inciteful**](https://inciteful.com/), to streamline and optimise the paper discovery process. Using machine learning, **Connected Papers** analyses citation patterns to reveal relationships between papers. In order to provide personalised paper suggestions, **R Discovery** uses recommendation algorithms and natural language processing. Using NLP, **Humata AI** analyses paper content and offers tailored recommendations. With **Litmaps**, users can discover thematic papers using machine learning and natural language processing. **Inciteful** uses artificial intelligence to understand user behaviour and recommend relevant articles, while **ResearchRabbit** analyses user inputs to recommend relevant papers. These AI tools contribute to paper discovery efficiency and effectiveness, making it easier for researchers to navigate the expansive academic landscape.

### Paper Visualization
Using advanced artificial intelligence techniques, paper visualisation tools help researchers navigate and comprehend the complex landscape of scholarly literature. Using semantic analysis and machine learning algorithms, [**Open Knowledge Maps**](https://openknowledgemaps.org) create interactive visual knowledge maps that provide an intuitive overview of a research topic. A network visualisation created by [**VOSviewer**](https://www.vosviewer.com/) is based on clustering algorithms and term extraction methods, facilitating the exploration of relationships between **papers**, **authors**, and **keywords**. In 
[**CiteSpace**](http://cluster.cis.drexel.edu/~cchen/citespace/), emerging trends are detected using algorithms and the chronological evolution of fields is visualised using algorithms. In bibliometric data, [**Gephi**](https://gephi.org/) provides visually appealing graphs for exploring connections. The [**Bibliometrix**](https://bibliometrix.org/) package combines statistical methods with visualisation capabilities to create insightful visualisations, such as co-authorship networks and keyword co-occurrence maps.** Researchers can navigate and contribute to the scholarly conversation more efficiently with the help of these AI-powered tools.

### Copywriting with ChatGPT
In order to explore copywriting with ChatGPT from an academic perspective, one must examine how AI and writing work together. Using ChatGPT, we can create better writing. Based on what users ask, this AI can create detailed and fitting writing using smart computer programs. By examining this from an academic perspective, we can better understand how ChatGPT handles language intricacies and adapts to different writing styles. As a result, we gain a better understanding of how technology and language are interconnected. In addition to showing the potential of AI-driven writing, this study also makes us think about language details, ethics, and how human creativity fits into a world of smart machines.

### Chatbot and Detecting AI-Generated Content
The use of artificial intelligence (AI) tools has revolutionised the way tasks are performed and increased efficiency in a wide range of fields. One of the noteworthy tools is AIPRM for ChatGPT, which facilitates prompt management and community-driven prompt libraries. The ChatGPT Writer Chrome extension leverages ChatGPT AI to generate emails and replies based on keywords entered by the user. By displaying ChatGPT responses alongside regular search results, ChatGPT for Google enhances search engines. An experimental Google service called Bard AI pulls information from the web, similar to ChatGPT. A conversational AI chatbot for Bing's search engine, powered by OpenAI's GPT-4 technology, is Bing Chat. Natural language processing tasks have been significantly impacted by GPTZero, a Generative Pre-trained Transformer model. Copyleaks, a plagiarism checker, and Hello-SimpleAI's ChatGPT Detector are two of the DetectAI tools. In GPT-Minus1, words are replaced randomly with synonyms, while QuillBot provides grammar and paraphrasing assistance with the help of artificial intelligence. Another paraphrasing tool, Spinbot, uses AI to rewrite text, and Grammarly is a comprehensive writing tool. Collectively, these tools demonstrate AI's versatility in streamlining different tasks across various industries.
